\begin{abstract}
We give a brief update on our project of using machine learning to create a program that can accurately distinguish between real arXiv \texttt{hep-th} abstracts and fake abstracts generated by the program snarXiv.
Our progress consists of three major parts: obtaining large amounts of data in an efficient way, parsing the abstract text to prepare it for analysis, and implementing a simple classification algorithm -- a naive Bayes classifier using a bag-of-words model.
We chose this extremely simple classifier to serve as a proof of concept, though it already outperforms humans (successful classification rate is 75-80\% vs. 59\% for humans).
